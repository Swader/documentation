# PHP-HTTP Utilities

The utilities package provides some useful tools for working with HTTP. Include them in your project with composer:

``` bash
composer require "php-http/utils" "^1.0"
```

## HttpMethodsClient

This client wraps the HttpClient and provides convenience methods for common HTTP requests like `GET` and `POST`. To be able to do that, it also wraps a message factory.

``` php
use Http\Discovery\HttpClientDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\MessageFactoryDiscovery

$client = new HttpMethodsClient(
    HttpClientDiscovery::find(),
    MessageFactoryDiscovery::find()
);

$foo = $client->get('http://example.com/foo');
$bar = $client->get('http://example.com/bar', ['accept-encoding' => 'application/json']);
$post = $client->post('http://example.com/update', [], 'My post body');
```

## BatchClient

This client wraps a HttpClient and extends it with the possibility to send an array of requests and to retrieve their responses as a `BatchResult`.

``` php
use Http\Discovery\HttpClientDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\MessageFactoryDiscovery;

$messageFactory = MessageFactoryDiscovery::find();

$requests = [
    $messageFactory->createRequest('GET', 'http://example.com/foo'),
    $messageFactory->createRequest('POST', 'http://example.com/update', [], 'My post body'),
];

$client = new BatchClient(
    HttpClientDiscovery::find()
);

$batchResult = $client->sendRequests($requests);
```

The `BatchResult` itself is an object that contains responses for all requests sent. It provides methods that give appropriate information based on a given request.

``` php
$requests = [
    $messageFactory->createRequest('GET', 'http://example.com/foo'),
    $messageFactory->createRequest('POST', 'http://example.com/update', [], 'My post body'),
];

$batchResult = $client->sendRequests($requests);

if ($batchResult->hasResponses()) {
    $fooSuccessful = $batchResult->isSuccesful($requests[0]);
    $updateResponse = $batchResult->getResponseFor($request[1]);
}
```

If one or more of the requests throw exceptions, they are added to the `BatchResult` and the `BatchClient` will ultimately throw a `BatchException` containing the `BatchResult` and therefore its exceptions.

``` php
$requests = [
    $messageFactory->createRequest('GET', 'http://example.com/update'),
];

try {
    $batchResult = $client->sendRequests($requests);
} catch (BatchException $e) {
    var_dump($e->getResult()->getExceptions());
}
```
